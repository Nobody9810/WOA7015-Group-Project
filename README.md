# WOA7015-Group-Project
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), often referred to as autism, are neurological disorders characterised by deficits in cognitive skills, social and communicative behaviours. A common way of diagnosing ASD is by studying behavioural cues expressed by the children, and one of the popular symptoms is hand/arm flapping. Hand flapping is a form of Autism stimming. It refers to repetitive hand movement that occurs up and down or side-to-side. It can include finger wiggling, clapping, moving arms, shaking, clenching fists, or any other variation of these flipping characteristics. 
In this project, you will investigate the possibility of classifying the different flipping characteristics based on the Self-Stimulatory Behaviours in the Wild for Autism Diagnosis Dataset (SSBD). There are about 25 videos of hand flapping in the SSBD dataset.
